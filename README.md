## 📈 Key Findings & Strategic Insights

The analysis yielded several crucial insights into Netflix’s content evolution:

- **TV Show Prioritization:** While movies still dominate, TV Shows have seen a steeper growth rate, reflecting a strategic pivot towards long-form content for higher engagement and retention.

- **Dominant & Emerging Genres:** Dramas, International Movies, and Comedies remain strong pillars. However, Documentaries and International TV Shows show notable recent growth, signaling evolving audience preferences.

- **Global Content Focus:** The catalog is heavily skewed toward the United States. Growth in India and the UK reflects successful localization. Future strategy should prioritize underrepresented, high-growth regions such as South America and emerging Asian markets.
